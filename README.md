bring "Hello, world"
# Result: Hello, world
```
Yes! Exactly.
# Varible!
```raccoon
int testvar = "Hello, world"
  bring testvar
#result: Hello, world
```
# Cycles!
```raccoon
int testvar = 0
while testvar != 5
  bring testvar
  testvar += 1
 end
 #result: output 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```
# input data in console!
for this we need use input. example:
```raccoon
bring "Whats your name?"
name = input
bring "Hello " + + name
```
